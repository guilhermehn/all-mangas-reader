# Manga Reader

Manga Reader is a Chrome extension for a complete reading manga experience.
Track your favorite mangas, receive notifications about new chapters and read
a whole chapter in one page (no more paginated reading).

This is a *complete rewrite* of [AllMangasReader](https://github.com/AllMangasReader-dev/AMR)
since it's now unmaintained, full of buggy code, copy-paste blocks and unfinished functionality.

Almost everything will change, becoming almost a complete different
extension, but the core ideia will be the same.

#### The project is under heavy development and still full of bugs
