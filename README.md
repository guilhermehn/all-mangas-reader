#AllMangasReader *Rebirth*
> AllMangasReader source code

AllMangasReader is a Chrome extension for a complete reading manga experience.
Track your favorite mangas, receive notifications about new chapters and read
a whole chapter in one page (no more paginated reading).

A ***complete rewrite*** since the original version is now unmaintained, full of buggy code,
copy-paste blocks and unfinished functionality.

###The project is under heavy development and still full of bugs

##Installation

1. Clone the git repository
2. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
3. Activate `Developers Mode` option
4. Click `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦`
5. Look for the folder with the extension
